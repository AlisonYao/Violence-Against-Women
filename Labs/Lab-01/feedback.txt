Alison, 
Great job! 

Some minor comments: 

1. I do not see which command was used to obtain the information about the structure of the dataset: 

Help command is one option

```{r}
?datasaurus_dozen

```
Or, alternatively, you can use the command View()

```{r}
View(datasaurus_dozen)

```


2. Function print used in lines 28 and 127 of the code. Function print() has several arguments (you can check help ?print()).
Instead of print(13), when you do not specify what 13 stands for, use print(n=13), by this we specify that we want R to 
print 13 rows (n is a number of rows). If you do not specify what is equal to 13, it will set the first argument 
of the print() function to 13. This argument is width. 


3. Comparison of correlation coefficients. If both correlation coefficients are negative, we compare their absolute values,
and the one with a higher absolute value exhibits a stronger linear relationship between x and y. Dino r = -0.0645, 
and star r = -0.063. Both of them are negative - inverse relationship between x and y, but dino is slightly bigger 
(implying a slightly higher correlation between x and y) than star. Though the difference is negligible. In both cases 
our conclusion is that x and y are not related linearly, but rather non linearly, and we see it from our plots. 

Best, 
Renata
